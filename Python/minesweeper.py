# made this back in 2021 as a side project, thought I'd share.

#Not the most intuitive to play, but still better than the modern Microsoft Minesweeper!
#To play, enter the coordinates of the tile you want to strike.
#The grid appears after every strike.

#Yes, you need to make the first strike blind.
#It's okay, it would have been blind anyways since all the tiles were covered.
